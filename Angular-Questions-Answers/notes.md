Decorators are functions that are invoked with a prefixed @ symbol, and immediately followed by a class, parameter, method or property.

Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.

Components control views (html). They also communicate with other components and services to bring functionality to your app.

Modules consist of one or more components. They do not control any html. Your modules declare which components can be used by components belonging to other modules, which classes will be injected by the dependency injector and which component gets bootstrapped. Modules allow you to manage your components to bring modularity to your app.

A Directive modifies the DOM to change apperance, behavior or layout of DOM elements. Directives are one of the core building blocks Angular uses to build applications.
